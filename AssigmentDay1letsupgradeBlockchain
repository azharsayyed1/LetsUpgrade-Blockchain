Transaction records
Previous block signature
Mining key (Nonce)

Q5.How is the Verifiability of Blockchain is been attained.
Day1:Document=Signature
Day2:Document+Previous signature
Day3:Document+Previous signature(Day2+day1)
Incase if the signature doesnt matches then the data has been purely manipulated we can attain the verifiability with sigantures.
